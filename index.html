<br>

<p>1st and 2nd groups consist of note types Wombo Combos, it can progress at a different scale depending on the length, however they aren't stuck in prisonners walls</p>
<p>3rd group consist of miscellaneous useful types, lighten stream visually, slice as a mini part on its own, and also doing well a celibate.
<p>The ground lane should in most cases be a little bit more dominant than the air lane by like 10-15% in term of stuff</p>

<p>I’am gonna use the vertical view which was the only one at the old times from the genesis.</p>

<h3>Measure Scale</h3>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

<div>
<img src="MDMC/Measure_Division.png" alt="Measure_Division" style="width: 74px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.2em;">
Here is the measure starting with 002 as a tradition when offset, it’s also called a rhythm unit section.<br>
The real time value depends on the BPM like in equations you first need to tell X(BPM) to have Y(Real Time).<br>
In music, the default structure time signature is 4/4.<br>
In simple terms that's the timestamp consistency regarding the repeating cycle of patterns.<br>
<br>
1/4 is the first bar (supposed to start at 0/4 and 4/4 to be a new measure but since it is counter-intuitive...)<br>
2/4 is second bar<br>
3/4 is the third bar also called half measure (there will be first and second half measure so)<br>
4/4 is fourth bar<br>
Then it repeats again and again<br>
All of them are highlighted lines and will be called bold bars<br>

<p>Note that we are talking about the bars on when to change lane and not necessarely on actual beats
We can also multiply the scale of those values by 2.
For example {4-4} can be {8-8} in some extent so that litteraly mean each measure own completely the content.
In the negative multiplication which imply streams impairs values are flawed.
1 can't be 0.5 since we always deal in integer numbers.
the grid is supposed to be 16/4 but i'am talking like it's 8/4 which is more simpler to image lane swap.
So i could write it that way {4-1-3 S} S for stream and {8-8} being {4-4 C} C for complete, entire measure so to speak.</p>


<hr style="margin: 64px auto;">

<h3>Mirroring</h3>
<p>Ctrl+R is a shortcut to reverse the selected stuff [ground to air] and [air to ground].</p>

<p>We know that an impair value of lane usage result to a lane swap.<br>
The lane swap for Impair Dynamic is done earlier than it is supposed to do to mirror properly measure by measure.<br>
We can count {Impair Passive} and {Pair Passive-Dynamic/Dynamic-Passive} as having this property but we can also mix up to able a total of 4x4 options.<br>
<br>
Basically it's one of the half measure consisting of a main lane and swapping to another with a balanced pair dynamic.
If a measure main lane is A it goes like this:<br>

<p>The followed example consist of 3 or 5 lane variation units which cover a good proportion to be between zig zags and single laning.</p>
<p>Make sure the <b>final note</b> is at the same lane during the last section measure!</p>
<p>By the way, geminis are considered "laneless" for its undecisive lane favorism and can cover loners notes.</p>
<p>A long masher can personnally be considered as a full measure long.<br>
I consider their ability to reset lane change making pure symmetry unconsequencial although that's only true if the next section isn't a repeating one.</p>

<hr style="margin: 64px auto;">

<h3>Hold [Note Type]</h3>

<p>The Hold in the air is the default lane for this note although this could be to debate.
Why ? Cuz the main lane is where it's the most active and the current tap notes would mean to be on the ground.
An air hold end tail makes you fall instantly to the ground but with late click with grnd hold air ennemy end tail physics can makes you jump</p>

<p>Holds are versatiles and play a major role on each part being different from others as being one of the most creative note cuz they have a unique property, they can signature pretty much all sections but not being mixed up with bad spacing, though they are many type of them.
They are almost always followed by a tap note on the end tail at the opposite lane.
There are several types of holds arrangement.</p>

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;">

<div>
<dt><b><u>Singular Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Fill the little blank, no inherent rules beside the equanimy of lane placement.</dd>

<dd>Complex tool, not easy to catch at high a BPM.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Short.png" alt="Hold_Short" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Connected Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Alternate main lane, most of the time with consistent length on bold bars but not all the time, the last one may be shorter.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Connected.png" alt="Hold_Connected" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Angular Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Emphasis arrangement, also substitute to single gemini at measure start.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Angular.png" alt="Hold_Angular" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Compact Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Tighten hold tails on the same lane that combo well with Angular hold.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Compact.png" alt="Hold_Compact" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Focus Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Keep dominance over a lane.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Focus.png" alt="Hold_Focus" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Tap Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Electronic lag sound or soft silence with a unique visual tap effect used mostly in transitions.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Tap.png" alt="Hold_Tap" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<dt><b><u>Sandwich Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>A long one and 2 short ones.</dd>

</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Staircase Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>Double hold equal in length but with a spicy timing difference, extremely situational and the rarest case.</dd>
<img src="MDMC/Hold_Staircase.png" alt="Hold_Staircase" style="width: 200px; height: 280px">
</div>

<div>
<dt><b><u>Gemini Hold</u></b></dt>
<dd>On this arrangement, it adds separative distinction to patterns like geminis but even more with it's spacing.</dd>

<hr style="margin: 64px auto;">

<h3>Gear [Note Type]</h3>

Gears are mostly to use on first or half measures (1/4 & 3/4)<br>
By the way if you can put one on one of these, you're probably right to do so on standards structures.<br>
Gears can be put at the borders of notes<br>
They could also signature a middle point on triplets.<br>
Boss gears does have a summoning animation at the front which make them harder to read and dodge.
On the beginning of the boss section we don't use gears instantly.<br>
It is plausible to put one on the 2nd 3rd 4th as a gemini cutter like if possible.
<hr style="margin: 64px auto;">

<h3>Journey</h3>

<p>Section difficulties should feet the song intensity and the target difficulty.</p>
<p>The start of a chart shouldn't be the hardest part even if the opening of the song is rough.</p>

<p>If a transition part happen to be somewhere at a 4th measure, it's often subject to a pattern buff.</p>

<h2>Polyrhythm</h2>

<p>Polyrhythm consist of theming instruments beats with a specific lane and note type. It's a sort of ruling structure following 2 to 4 tracks at the same time.
This type of charting imply a significant number of double taps.


<table border="1" style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">

<h2>Random notes</h2>
Consistency
From Easy to Hard
Mediums types as a duet can
offer design variation mirroring with possibly an emphasis note as a divider
be divided by lane (transition with usually a masher at the end)
switch with each one a different structure
Gemini are Laneless

Larges types as a duet can
swap copypasted (no normal notes)
A Consensus & A Different Point of View
Lanes & Directions
Monsters direction contain a difficulty value at reading!
No Directions
Ease
Cross
The Boss add usually the necessity to "frontal projectile" they appear on the screen late, it's like you don't see them at the border, that's why they are harder to stream than monsters, Monsters are also interesting if u don't want "frontal late appearing notes" but that shouldn't be the main arguement to this decision. They need a little more reflex reading than normal notes
sometimes phase 1 is easier to read than boss phase 2
- Opposite direction of a Monster Note based on his lane
- Raider in the air
-  Hammer in the ground
Are the 3 ways of highest energy moving, in charting we must keep the balance with the song interpretation.
